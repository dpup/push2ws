push2ws: PubSubHubbub To Web Socket Bridge
==========================================

push2ws is a Go library that creates a
[PubSubHubbub](https://pubsubhubbub.googlecode.com/) subscriber which forwards
updates to a Web Socket.

It was created for a personal project, so may not be super reusable, but happy
to take PRs to better generalize it.

For API documentation see https://godoc.org/github.com/dpup/push2ws
